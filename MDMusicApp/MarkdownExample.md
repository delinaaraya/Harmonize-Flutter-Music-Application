# Project Title

## Description

This is a simple project to demonstrate the use of **GitHub Markdown**. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to structurally valid HTML.

## Features

- Easy to write and read
- Supports **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~ text
- Enables the use of `code` snippets
- Allows [linking](http://example.com) to web resources

## Code Snippet Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()







### Explanation:

- `# Project Title`: This line creates a top-level heading using `#`. It's typically used for the title of the document or the main heading.

- `## Description`: This creates a second-level heading using `##`. Subheadings are useful for structuring your document into sections.

- The paragraph under **Description** is just plain text. Markdown will format it into readable paragraphs in the rendered output.

- `## Features`: Another second-level heading for a new section.

- The list of features uses `-` to create bullet points. Markdown lists are straightforward, using `-`, `*`, or `+` for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.

- **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~: Demonstrates text formatting. Bold is achieved with `**text**`, italic with `*text*`, and strikethrough with `~~text~~`.

- `` `code` ``: Inline code is wrapped in backticks.

- `[linking](http://example.com)`: This is how you create a link. The text you want to display as the link is in square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses.

- ```python and ```: These lines indicate a code block, with "python" specifying syntax highlighting for Python. Markdown supports code blocks for various programming languages, making it easy to include readable code snippets.

- The contributors and license sections are more plain text and bullet points, demonstrating how you might structure a simple document.

This example covers some basic Markdown features used in GitHub documents. The rendered output would show headings, formatted text, a bullet list, a syntax-highlighted code block, and a hyperlink, all formatted according to the Markdown syntax specified.
